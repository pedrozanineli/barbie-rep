Physico-chemical properties study

| Beamline | Experiment | Objective | Scheduled Date | Result |
|----------|------------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| IMBUIA | Microplastics measurement | Base parameter for identifying bonds | 28/06 | - |
| IMBUIA | MP-protein binding FTIR nano | Identify the vibrational frequency of the protein binding with the particle | 19-20/07 | - |
| CEDRO | - | - | 5-7/08 | - |

IMBUIA measurement:
- Protein + surfactant used (background measurement)
- Drip to film formation (not only ATR measurement)

CEDRO measurement:
- Heating ramp - melting point + protein unfolding (95ºC maximum)
- **Isoelectric point** - protein protonation
- Mickey recipient - < 0.5 mg/mL
- Phosphate buffer, Lindomar can lend (chloride increases tension and loses quality)

---

**CEDRO** - each experiment - 270 µL - 0.2~0.5 mg/mL

1. Temperature experiment - heat ramp to 95ºC, compare melting point CBM and BARBIE
2. pH experiments 3 - 5 - 7 - 9 - 11 (which ecossystem? Biosensor adaptation e.g)

6 experiments, 6 x 270 = 1,620 mL, ~5 mL for each protein
